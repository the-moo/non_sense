Nothing of any value to anyone

These programs are simply a collection of things made while trying to teach myself Python.  They are likely of dubious quality and are unlikely to produce the desired outcome, if they do anything at all.  Any notations in the programs intended to guide you are most likely cryptic and vague.  If you do choose to utilize these for any reason, except for classroom examples of shoddy coding practices or just a good laugh at my expense, you do so at your own risk.  I bear no responsibility for triggering the apocalypse, making you sterile, raising milk prices, un-patterned baldness, sudden desires to eat cat food, strange visual occurrences, alien invasions or any other outcomes or side effects that may occur as a result of using such terrible computer programs.
